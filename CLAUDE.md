# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Current state

**Phase 1 is done: the pure round-trip core.** Contract schema (`src/lib/contract/`),
parser (`src/lib/parse/`), diff engine (`src/lib/diff/`), export generator
(`src/lib/export/`) and both prompt templates (`src/lib/templates/`) — pure functions
over plain data, no UI, no SQLite, no HTTP. Phases 2–7 have not started; the build-order
table in ARCHITECTURE §12 is the map.

Commands (Node 24 LTS — see `.nvmrc` and the `engines` field):

- `npm install` — dependencies
- `npm test` — Vitest; includes the golden round-trip test, the project's spine
- `npm run typecheck` — strict TypeScript, `tsc --noEmit`
- `npm run lint` — ESLint
- `npm run format` / `npm run format:check` — Prettier. `docs/`, `fixtures/` and
  `templates/` are byte-sensitive and excluded from formatting; never remove them from
  `.prettierignore`

Read [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) first, then
[`docs/CONTRACT.md`](docs/CONTRACT.md), before doing anything substantive. The twelve
design decisions in ARCHITECTURE §2 are settled — implement against them rather than
relitigating them. The same applies to
[`docs/UI-DECISIONS.md`](docs/UI-DECISIONS.md), which settles how the session runner
behaves; read it before touching anything user-facing.

### Stack

TypeScript + SvelteKit, single Node container, SQLite via `better-sqlite3`, Zod for
contract validation, Vitest for tests. One image, one port, one volume. The phase-1 core
is plain TypeScript with no framework — SvelteKit arrives with phase 3.

Node version, package manager, lint/format and CI are settled in ARCHITECTURE §12,
"Toolchain, settled". Implement those choices; do not make them again.

### How to report back

Short and scannable — bullets over prose, lead with what changed, and put anything I need
to decide under its own heading at the end, numbered so I can reply "1. yes, 2. no". Never
bury a question mid-paragraph. Ask rather than guess, and give a recommendation with the
question. This mirrors `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`; the global file is authoritative.

Design documents in this repo are the exception — `docs/` is written for AI agents and a
human reviewer, and its prose is deliberate. Do not "bullet-ify" it.

## What this app is

GAIN is the structured middle of a copy-paste loop. An AI writes a training plan in
some external chat; the user imports the Markdown here, trains and logs offline, then
exports a bundle to feed back to an AI for revision.

```
AI chat  ──md──►  import  ──►  train & log  ──►  export  ──md──►  AI chat
(external)      (structured)   (offline PWA)   (bundle)         (external)
```

**GAIN never calls an AI.** No API keys, no chat UI, no LLM in any code path. This is a
decision, not a gap.

**The loop is the product.** Everything else exists to make one round of it worth
completing, so every crossing between GAIN and an AI must be one tap out and one paste
back. Nothing the user assembles by hand, no format knowledge required, paste as the
primary transport, one document per crossing. A user who finds the handoff clumsy stops
revising, and an unrevised plan is a notes app with extra steps. See ARCHITECTURE §1.

A new user has no plan, so nothing to export, so **the loop cannot start itself.** That is
what `templates/bootstrap-prompt.md` is for — see ARCHITECTURE §7.

## The architecture that isn't obvious from any single file

### A plan is two representations, and both round-trip

A plan document is a ~350-line **skeleton** (a catalogue of every movement, then sessions
→ blocks → prescriptions, inside one fenced ` ```gain-plan ` YAML block) wrapped in ~500
lines of **prose context** (rationale, form cues, injury rules, progression philosophy).

The split is strict: **prose holds the reasoning, the block holds the prescription.**
Neither restates the other. Sets, reps, loads and rest appear only in the block; a plan
that also spells them out in prose has to keep two copies in sync and will not.

The skeleton is parsed into SQLite and drives the UI. The context is stored **verbatim**
and replayed into exports byte-for-byte. GAIN never paraphrases, summarises or
regenerates context — anything it cannot parse, it preserves. Nearly all of the document
is useless to the session UI and essential to the next AI revision.

### Exercise slugs are load-bearing, and their failure mode is silent

Every chart, progression calculation and trend join keys on `exercise_def.slug`,
resolved from the contract block's `id` fields. If a revised plan returns
`goblet-squat` as `goblet_squat`, history splits in two, nothing errors, and the loss is
unrecoverable. `plan.slug`, session `key` and metric `key` carry the same property.

Three defences, all of which must survive refactors: ID-preservation rules restated in
every export, rename detection in the import diff, and never silently minting a slug that
closely resembles an existing one.

### Isolation is physical, not a WHERE clause

Each user gets their own `gain.db` and their own directory under `/data/users/<id>/`.
There is no cross-user query because there is no cross-user database. There is no admin
role and no code path by which one user reads another's data. Do not introduce a shared
table keyed by `user_id`.

### Offline is a hard requirement, not a nicety

Workout state lives client-side in IndexedDB and syncs when it can. All writes carry a
client-generated ULID and are idempotent server-side, so replaying the sync queue can
never duplicate a set. A workout must survive connection loss, phone lock, browser kill,
container restart, and an expired session — a 401 must never discard queued local data.

## Invariants

These break things quietly, and no test catches them today:

- **`context_md` is byte-identical** through import → storage → export → re-import. The
  export replays `source_md` verbatim as Section 1, so the plan document is copied, never
  reassembled from `context_md` plus a block. The bundle itself is **not** re-importable —
  an AI reads a bundle and returns a plan document, and a pasted bundle gets an explanation
  rather than a second supported input format. See ARCHITECTURE §11.
- **Import is all-or-nothing.** On any validation failure, report the failing field and
  write nothing. Never partially import.
- **`docs/CONTRACT.md` is shipped output, not internal documentation.** It is reproduced
  verbatim in **both** outbound templates — Section 4 of every export and Section 2 of the
  bootstrap prompt — so editing it changes the instructions every AI receives, whether it
  is authoring a first plan or revising one.
- **Validation errors are written for an AI to read.** Field path, expected, found,
  copy-pasteable. The user's recovery from a bad import is pasting the error back into
  their chat, never hand-editing YAML.
- **Both outbound templates instruct the AI to ask rather than assume**, with worked
  examples. "I have dumbbells" must produce a question about plates and increments, not a
  guessed weight. A wrong assumption is silent: it becomes a prescription the user cannot
  perform, and they conclude the plan is not for them. The only sanctioned estimates are a
  starting load and a starting rep target, both only after asking and both labelled as
  estimates in the prose.
- **Contract changes touch three places together:** `docs/CONTRACT.md`, the Zod schema,
  and the fixture. A spec change that leaves the fixture stale is a broken change.
- **The contract key is `plan`, and synonyms are not accepted.** `plan.slug`,
  `plan_version`, `plan_id`. The word was chosen partly because it is spelled
  identically in every variety of English, unlike `programme`/`program` — but a revising
  AI will still reach for `program`, `routine` or `workout`. The parser must reject those
  loudly rather than coercing them, and nothing may reintroduce them as aliases.

## The fixture

[`fixtures/plans/home-dumbbell-v1.md`](fixtures/plans/home-dumbbell-v1.md) is
the spine of the phase-1 test suite.

- **It is fictional, and must stay that way.** The profile, training history and symptom
  context are invented. It is modelled closely on a real AI-authored plan so it
  behaves like one, but this repository is public — never commit real health data to it,
  in fixtures, tests or examples.
- It exercises every primitive in one file: a rounds block, checkoff warm-ups, two
  conditional exercises, per-side reps and per-side time, ranged sets and ranged rest,
  bodyweight-to-loaded progressions, catalogue rest defaults overridden per occurrence,
  a movement that exists only as a substitute, and metrics at all three scopes.
- Its oddities are **deliberate test cases, not defects.** The eight documented
  interpretations in "Import notes" should not be tidied away.
- 23 exercises, 60 prescriptions, 4 sessions. The catalogue declares each movement once,
  so an exercise appearing in three sessions has one entry and three prescriptions — and
  one entry, `lying-triceps-extension`, has none, because it is only ever a substitute.

## Build order

Phase 1 is the pure round-trip core with **no UI at all**: contract parser, diff engine,
export generator, plus the golden test that imports the fixture, logs synthetic workouts,
exports, re-imports, and asserts every ID survives and `context_md` is unchanged.

Everything else is built on that guarantee, so it comes first. Full phase table in
ARCHITECTURE §12.

Parsing, diffing, progression logic and export generation are pure functions over plain
data — no I/O, and the clock is injected so they stay deterministic.

## Non-goals

Do not build, and do not propose: in-app AI or chat; an exercise library with demo
videos; social or sharing features; nutrition tracking beyond plan-declared metrics;
wearable, Health/Fit or Strava integration; a native mobile app; or a calendar with
planned-schedule adherence.
